	<h3> <a name="History">History</a> </h3>
	<p align="center"> The Miami area was occupied by the Native American tribe called <b>Tequesta</b> around 2000 years prior to any contact with Europeans. The mouth of the Miami River was home to thousands of people, dating to 500-600 B.C. with many villages spread across. It is believed that the entirety of the Tequesta tribe later migrated to Cuba by the mid-1700s. In 1566, admiral Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, Florida's first governor, claimed the area for Spain. A Spanish mission was constructed one year later. Spain and Britain successively ruled Florida until Spain ceded it to the United States in 1821. In 1836, the U.S. built Fort Dallas on the banks of the Miami River as part of its development of the Florida Territory and its attempt to suppress and remove the Seminoles. As a result, the Miami area became a site of fighting in the Second Seminole War. </p>

	<p align="center"> Miami is noted as the only major city in the United States founded by a woman. <b>Julia Tuttle</b>, a local citrus grower and a wealthy Cleveland native, was the original owner of the land upon which the city was built. In the late 19th century, the area was known as "Biscayne Bay Country", and reports described it as a promising wilderness and "one of the finest building sites in Florida". Julia Tuttle became known as "the mother of Miami”. Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896, with a population of just over 300. It was named for the Miami River, derived from Mayaimi, the historic name of Lake Okeechobee and the Native Americans that lived around it. </p>

	<p align="center"> Miami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and infrastructure as northerners moved to the city. The collapse of <b>the Florida land boom</b> of the 1920s, the 1926 Miami Hurricane, and <b>the Great Depression</b> in the 1930s slowed development. When World War II began, Miami became a base for U.S. defense against German submarines due to its prime location on the southern coast of Florida. This brought an increase in Miami's population. The city's nickname, <b>The Magic City</b>, came from its rapid growth, which was noticed by winter visitors who remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic. </p>

	<p align="center"> After Fidel Castro rose to power in Cuba following the Revolution in 1959, many wealthy Cubans sought refuge in Miami, further increasing the city's population. Miami developed new businesses and cultural amenities as part of the New South in the 1980s and 1990s. At the same time, South Florida weathered social problems related to drug wars, immigration from Haiti and Latin America, and the widespread destruction of Hurricane Andrew. </p>

	<h3> <a name="Geography">Geography</a> </h3>
	<p align="center"> Miami is located on a broad plain between the Everglades to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east. The elevation of the area is around 1.8 meters above sea level in most neighborhoods, especially near the coast. The highest points are located near the Miami Rock Ridge. The main portion of the city is on the shores of Biscayne Bay, which contains hundreds of natural and artificial barrier islands. The Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current allows the city to stay warm and mild all year long. </p>

	<h4> <a name="Geology">Geology</a> </h4>
	<p align="center"> The surface bedrock under Miami is limestone. The Miami limestone formed as a result of changes in sea level associated with ice ages. Around 130 thousand years ago all of Southern Florida, including Miami, was covered by a shallow sea. Starting about 100 thousand years ago the Wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels so by around 15 thousand years ago the sea level dropped to 100m below the current level. The sea level rose and stabilized around 4000 years ago, leaving the mainland of South Florida above sea level. Underneath the plain lies the <b>Biscayne Aquifer</b>, a natural source of fresh water. Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from this source. Due to the existence of this aquifer it is not possible to dig more than 5 to 6 meters beneath the city, which impedes underground construction. This is also the main reason why transit systems in Miami are elevated. </p>

	<p align="center"> The city encompasses a total area of around 150 square kilometers, of which 95 is land and 55 is water. That means Miami comprises over 470 thousand people in about 90 square kilometers, making it one of the smallest major cities as well as one of the most densely populated cities in the United States. </p>

	<h4> <a name="Neighborhoods">Neighborhoods</a> </h4>
	<p align="center">Miami is split into north, south, west and Downtown areas, however the heart of the city is <b>Downtown Miami</b>. It’s Florida’s largest and most influential business district with a large residential population. The University of Miami is located in Downtown Miami. The southern side of Miami three neighborhoods: Coral Way, The Roads and Coconut Grove. The western side consists of Little Havana, West Flagler and Flagami. The northern side of Miami includes Midtown, Edgewater and Wynwood. </p>

	<h4> <a name="Climate">Climate</a> </h4>
	<p align="center"> Miami has a tropical monsoon climate with a marked drier season in the winter. Average winter high temperatures from December to March vary around 25°C. January is the coolest month with an average daily temperature of 20°C. After the passage of cold fronts low temperatures fall below 10°C. The wet season begins sometime in June, ending in mid-October. During this period, temperatures range from the mid-80s to 29–35 °C and are accompanied by high humidity, though the heat is often relieved in the afternoon by thunderstorms or a sea breeze that develops off the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the year's 1,572 mm of rainfall occurs during this period. Dew points in the warm months range from 22°C in June to 23°C in August. Extremes range from 2.8 °C on February 3, 1917 to 38 °C on July 21, 1942. While Miami has never recorded snowfall at any official weather station since records have been kept, snow flurries fell in some parts of the city on January 19, 1977. </p>

	<p align="center"> Hurricane season officially runs from June 1 through November 30, although hurricanes can develop beyond those dates. The most likely time for Miami to be hit is during the peak of the Cape Verde season, which is mid-August through the end of September. Although tornadoes are uncommon in the area, one struck in 1925 and another in 1997. </p>

    <p align="center"> Miami is home to less than one-thirteenth of the population of South Florida. The city is the 42nd-most populous city in the United States. The Miami metropolitan area, however, had a combined population of more than 5.5 million people, ranked seventh largest in the United States and is the largest metropolitan area in the southeastern United States. As of 2008, the United Nations estimates that the Miami Urban Agglomeration is the 44th-largest in the world. </p>

    <p align="center"> In 1960, Hispanics made up about 5% of the population of Miami-Dade County. Between 1960 and 2000, 90% of the population growth in the county was made up of Hispanics, raising the Hispanic portion of the population to more than 57% by 2000.</p>

    <p align="center"> In 1970, the Census Bureau reported Miami's population as 45.3% Hispanic, 32.9% non-Hispanic White, and 22.7% Black. Miami's explosive population growth has been driven by internal migration from other parts of the country, primarily up until the 1980s, as well as by immigration, primarily from the 1960s to the 1990s. Today, immigration to Miami has continued and Miami's growth today is attributed greatly to its fast urbanization and high-rise construction, which has increased its inner-city neighborhood population densities, where one area in Downtown alone saw a 2,069% increase in population in the 2010 Census. Miami is regarded as more of a multicultural mosaic, with residents still maintaining much of, or some of their cultural traits. The overall culture of Miami is heavily influenced by its large population of Hispanics from the Caribbean and South America and black people mainly from the Caribbean islands.</p>
